### Attacks

**Launch**

Target any creature or object. Pointy hook launches towards the target from the top of your forearm, followed by a mithril chain. Make an attack roll. On success, hook hits the target and makes 1d8 piercing damage. Target is now hooked.

On failed attack, hook misses and lands on the floor near the target. You have to reel it in before you can attempt to launch again.

You can launch the hook with slower speed (for example, when targeting friendly creature). Your hook will not deal any damage, but you have to make an attack roll with disadvantage.

**Spin Around**

Attempt to spin around with hook still attached on your target. Both you and your target make a strength check, If your check is equal or higher than target's, you can perform the spin.

Target moves up to 90 degrees into either direction (with you as the center). Target takes 2d6 percing damage. If target hits anything while rotating, it stops while both target and hit object/creature take additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage. If chain hits anything during rotation, spinning stops.

Target can voluntarily decide to not hold back when you pull it, making you automatically win strength check.

**Reel hook back in**

Detach the hook (if necessary) and reel the chain back into your arm.
