**Size:** Small town  
**Has teleportation circle:** NO

Town of Kor'a'Fel was established centuries ago when first loggers arrived to south of Tookania and started cutting down the trees of the nearby forest. As the town slowly grew over time, most people's occupations were somehow related to the forest (logging, hunting, foraging etc.).

Town was prospering until a band of hobgoblins moved into the forest. They quickly spread and started making all forest activities more and more difficult, threating and occasionaly even kidnapping or killing outsiders. Fear for safety caused sharp decline of the town's population. 

As goblin activity rised and town was on the brink of being abandoned, Tookania's military stepped into action, starting infamous Annuvien Goblin War. During the war, town recovered and started growing again as war effort caused sudden demand for inns (For higher officers), healers and metal workers. Many of the remained in town even after the war, citing less stressful life on the edge of the continent, gaining town the nickname "Town of Iron". Many mechanical inventions in past years have been created right in this town by the collection of blacksmiths, artificers and tinkerers.

Today, town is described by some as being right on the perfect edge of Tookania. There is no teleportation circle, which slows down travel of information and goods, making life here more peaceful. On the other hand, traveling troupers and traders still ocasionally visit the town (unlike the more distant settlements), bringing at least some news and new trinkets into town.
